or... Why Traps Are Usually Bad<br />

Traps are a central part of TTRPGs as claimed by D&D (which is what I play mostly). But they never feel fun (at least not as I run & design them) for me the DM, or my players. But I just designed and ran a really good trap last night and it helped me identify a way to think about a solution.

## Value up front
In the interest of "getting value to the users"™, here's the solution:
Make traps be more than "identify the trap". One good way to do this is to have traps fire in stages, over time. Evading the trap goes from "Roll high enough to notice" to "I noticed its happening, can I use the clues given to figure out how to escape unharmed?"

In short - create more moments for **Player Skill**.

## How does a trap work?
Ok, let's back up – how was I designing traps before?
1. The Player Characters are walking through a room where there is a trap.
2. The DM tries to sneakily signal that there might be a trap.
  - This is acutually really hard to do well. You want there to be actaul things they can notice, but you also want them to feel smart for noticing at all. 
3. Player either asks to check for traps or not. << **Player Skill Moment**
  - If they check and succeed, they don't trigger the trap.
  - If they don't check, or don't succeed, the trap fires. **Punishment.**

## Player Skill vs Character Skill
Looking back on this kind of design, it's pretty clear that it's bad. I've decided that I think this is bad because it doesn't allow for player's to exhibit skill within the challenge.

TTRPGs focus so heavily on character sheets and stat blocks that its easy to forget, those aren't the things that make TTRPGs feel good to play. What does make them fun to play is the reward of wowing your friends, making your players cry, or flooring the DM with your ingenuity and understanding of the rules.

In other words, when we get to show that we are good at playing a TTRPG, we feel good! We like playing! And we make the experience better for everyone else at the table! 

This is a distinction between *Character Skill* and *Player Skill*.
Character Skill goes up in relation to in game events - you killed a monster, or saved the king.
Player Skill is constantly going up as long as they are paying attention to the game. (Wording here chosen to include thinking about the game when its not being played) 

So how can we use traps to give our players more opportunities to exhibit their skill?
Let's fix a trap:
*I'm using D&D 5e here because it's what I'm familiar with, but you can replace these rules with anything?*

## Bad Trap
- **Setting**: A stone hallway
- **Trigger**: There's a tripwire. 
- **Thwarting**: DC 14 Perception check to notice and avoid
- **Punishment**: acid sprays from nozels on the wall, 4d6 acid damage

## Better Trap
- **Setting**: A stone hallway. *Why mess with a good thing?*
- **Trigger**: There's a tripwire. 
- **Thwarting**: DC 14 Perception to notice and avoid the tripwire
- **Punishment**: Walls appear in front and behind you. The room slowly starts filling with acid. 1d6 acid damage every real-world minute the party remain in the room.

The thing I like about this is that now, punishment takes time. It's a matter of evading a sprung trap. More interesting than a failed die roll leading to punishment. 

But we can do better!

## "Best" Trap

- **Trigger**: There's a tripwire.
- **Thwarting**: DC 14 Perception to notice and avoid the tripwire
- **Punishment**: Walls begin to slide down in front of you.
- **Thwarting**: Prop doors open? Dex check to get out Indiana Jones style before they close? Idk, this is the player's job.
  - A cool potential moment: Half party gets out as the doors close. Half are still stuck inside, raising the stakes.
- **Punishment**: The doors slam closed. Acid begins to spray from nozels in the wall. 1d6 acid damage every real-world minute a PC remains in the room.
- **Thwarting**: Break the walls. Find a button to open the doors. Climb up the acid nozels. Idk let them come up with some crazy shit.

You can see where this is going - the trap went from a single event to an entire encounter. Spells might be cast now, abilities might be used. A healer might be separated from party members in need! Now we've got the bones of an exciting set of events!

## Takeaways

I don't think the thing to learn here is "Make Traps Take Time". Instead, the thing to learn is to find ways to let your players be creative.
